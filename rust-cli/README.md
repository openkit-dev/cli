# Rust CLI Bootstrap

This directory contains the Rust bootstrap for OpenKit Memory Kernel commands.

## Commands

- `openkit-rs memory init`
- `openkit-rs memory doctor`
- `openkit-rs memory capture`
- `openkit-rs memory review`

## Notes

- This scaffold is intentionally isolated from the current Go runtime.
- It defines the initial command contracts for staged migration.
- Use it as the foundation for S07-T004 through S07-T008.
