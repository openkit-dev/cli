# Clean Code Skill

Pragmatic coding standards - concise, direct, no over-engineering.

## Principles

1. **Single Responsibility**: One function/class does one thing
2. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Extract common patterns
3. **KISS (Keep It Simple)**: Prefer simple solutions
4. **Guard Clauses**: Early returns for edge cases
5. **Descriptive Names**: Self-documenting code

## Guidelines

- Functions: <= 20 lines
- Parameters: max 3 arguments
- Nesting: max 2 levels deep
- Comments: only for "why", not "what"
