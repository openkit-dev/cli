# Sprint Goal: Sprint-07

## Goal Statement

Establish OpenKit Memory Kernel v1 as an enforceable documentation and operational model, while creating a production-safe foundation for staged Rust CLI migration.

This sprint also defines and starts the deprecation path for legacy semantic memory plugin flows, preparing full removal in the next release window.

Execution and validation for this goal are tracked in [[sprint/Sprint-07/TASKS.md]], while adapter support policy is formalized in [[SUPPORT_MATRIX.md]].

## Success Indicators

- Requirement pack complete and internally linked.
- Sprint execution plan with traceable tasks and risks.
- Rust migration approach documented with explicit parity gates.
- Documentation policy updated to include inline wikilinks and `## Related` indexing.
- Legacy memory sunset strategy published with user migration guidance.

## Out of Scope

- Full replacement of existing Go CLI runtime.
- Full parity for all non-priority adapters in this sprint.
- Immediate hard removal of legacy memory plugin code without deprecation window.
