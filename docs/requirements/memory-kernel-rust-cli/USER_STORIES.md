# User Stories: Memory Kernel + Rust CLI Migration

## Story 1: Project Memory Integrity

As a maintainer, I want OpenKit to validate documentation memory health so that project context remains discoverable and reliable across sessions.

## Story 2: Obsidian Graph Quality

As a user who navigates the project in Obsidian, I want internal references to appear inline where concepts are discussed and also in `## Related` so that the graph reflects semantic relationships and not only footer lists.

## Story 3: Safe Migration

As a CLI maintainer, I want a staged Rust migration with compatibility tests so that users do not lose command behavior during transition.

## Story 4: Tiered Adapter Strategy

As a product owner, I want OpenCode to receive Tier-1 depth while Claude Code, Codex, and Antigravity remain Tier-2 supported so that roadmap focus increases without abandoning multi-agent strategy.

## Story 5: Operational Learning

As an engineering team member, I want sessions, observations, and tensions to be tracked in `.openkit/ops/` so that recurring friction becomes visible and can be turned into actionable improvements.

## Story 6: Legacy Memory Sunset

As a current OpenKit user, I want a clear deprecation and migration path from legacy semantic memory plugin commands to the new docs-first memory model so that I can upgrade without losing context or workflow continuity.

## Story 7: Maintainer Cleanup

As a maintainer, I want to remove old memory-plugin code paths after deprecation so that the CLI has a single memory architecture and lower maintenance burden.
