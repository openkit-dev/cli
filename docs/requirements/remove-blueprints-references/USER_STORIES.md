# User Stories: Remove Blueprint References

- As a maintainer, I want OpenKit documentation and skills to reference only shipped artifacts (templates/packs), so guidance is accurate.
- As a contributor, I want a single, consistent term ("templates") instead of "blueprints", so changes are easier to reason about.
- As a user, I want scans and audits to behave consistently without special-casing non-existent directories.
