# Feature Hub: remove-blueprints-references

Requirements for removing blueprint references.

## Context

Tracks removal of legacy "blueprints" terminology and related skip-list behavior to keep language and scanning behavior consistent.

## Status Overview

- Stage: In Progress (spec + plan exist; linked sprint is still active)
- Sprint linkage: `Sprint-06`
- Risk level: Medium (wording cleanup and scan-noise side effects remain possible)
