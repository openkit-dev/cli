# Feature Hub: semantic-memory

Requirements and analysis for semantic memory integration.

## Context

Tracks semantic memory integration for OpenKit/OpenCode, including architecture research, storage/embedding decisions, and implementation tracking.

## Status Overview

- Stage: In Progress (spec artifacts and analysis docs exist; implementation artifacts are active, but `PLAN.md` is missing)
- Sprint linkage: `Sprint-05`
- Risk level: High (risk register contains multiple high-probability/high-impact scenarios)
